### What is a package manager?

A package manager is a software tool that helps manage the installation, update, and removal of software packages on a computer system. It provides a convenient way to install and manage dependencies, resolve conflicts, and ensure that software components are properly installed and configured. Popular package managers include apt (Advanced Package Tool) for Debian-based systems, yum for Red Hat-based systems, and Homebrew for macOS.
